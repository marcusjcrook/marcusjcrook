## Hi there 👋, thanks for visiting my GitHub!

I'm a software engineer with 5+ years of industry experience, currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in Computing Systems

My Skills include:
▪ Programming Languages: PHP, Java, Python, C++, C#, JavaScript
▪ Databases: MySQL, Oracle (PL/SQL), SQL Server (T-SQL), NoSQL (Couchbase)
▪ Web Development: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
▪ Tools & Frameworks: Docker, Git, JetBrains (IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, PhpStorm, PyCharm), Composer, Postman, Smart GWT
▪ Project Management: Jira
▪ Monitoring & Logging: Splunk
▪ Libraries: jQuery, React, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, NetworkX, gurobipy

I'm passionate about theoretical computer science, especially algorithms and computational complexity theory, and mathematics in general (currently number theory)!

Most of my repos are private due to the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code, but I can showcase them to prospective employers. My public repos are quite dated, but showcase my skills using C++ and Java (at least the versions used in those projects)

Please see my LinkedIn for additional information 😁
